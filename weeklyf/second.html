                My week!
            </h3>

                I had another good week, just with a lot going on. I feel 
                like my classes long to stack all the big assignments and 
                tests at the same time. I have a lot to do at the 
                beginning of the week but it should slow down later on so I'm pretty 
                excited to just relax a little.

                I finally got the next grade up in rock climbing which I'm super 
                excited about. I can't wait to go tuesday to see if I can do more of 
                that difficulty :p
