            My week was actually pretty good despite being so busy with all 
            the work I had to do! I managed to get everything done with extra time 
            before the due dates so I was never rushing to complete anything. I managed 
            to apply for some internships as well so hopefully I can get one of those. Because I 
            was on top of my work, I got a little extra freetime so I was able to rock climb 
            a few times this week. I'm in a bit of a plateau in terms of what grades I'm able to 
            climb but I feel like I'm getting better so hopefully I can break through soon! Also, 
            Spotify wrapped came out this week which is always fun to see, and music has been really good 
            lately too!
