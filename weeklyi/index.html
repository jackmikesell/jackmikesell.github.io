            This week we mostly got time in class to work on our final 
            projects which is nice because that means less time outside of 
            class! Luckily my project won't be changing too much, I just have a 
            few features I want to add. They don't seem like much, but it's 
            taking a lot longer than expected to implement them just because they're 
            things I haven't tried before.

            I'm very excited for the semester to be over. Classes have been crazy 
            stressful lately just because they're all coming to an end so I have a lot 
            more midterms, projects, and quizzes than normal.
