    <h1>First Introduction to HTML! (weekly a)</h1>
    <div>
        <p>While I was given a brief introduction to html in my software 
            classes, they mostly give templates so you don't need to know 
            what you're doing.</p>
    </div>

    <span>
        <p>I had no idea what any of the element tags meant, 
        and would just use java to generate html based on the templates.
         To be fair, those classes are more focused on object oriented 
         programming as opposed to front end work. But I have always
          been interested in designing things on the front end as well.</p>
