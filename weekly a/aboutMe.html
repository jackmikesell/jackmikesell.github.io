            I had a pretty good week despite being SO busy with school. 
            My friends and I went to a Dominic Fike concert in cincy 
            on Tuesday which was so much fun. Sadly, I woke up Wednesday 
            sick which sucked big time, but by Friday I was feeling 
            better and I was able to have a great weekend with some 
            friends!

            Getting back into the swing of things with school and all 
            this homework has been a bit much, but I am definitely 
            happy to be back at OSU!
