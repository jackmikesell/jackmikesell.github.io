        <p class="para1">This week was pretty chaotic as I had a lot of makeup work 
            from last week when I was dealing with migraines. My mom and 
            grandma visited on Thursday for lunch, and it was really nice 
            to see them! It hasn't been the best week but generally November 
            is my worst month of the year so that's to be expected I guess! 
        </p>
        <p class="para2">In class we talked about an interesting javascript library that i'm excited 
            to put to use! Javascript seems pretty fun, it looks like it has a lot of 
            similarities to backend languages which I'm more familiar with. I've seen really 
            cool examples online of people's work who've used javascript to make interesting 
            features, so i'm looking forward to trying some myself.
