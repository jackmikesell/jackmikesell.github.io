            Honestly I had a really good week and was much less stressed than I have 
        been the last few weeks of school. I dropped a class that was taking up WAY 
        too much time, and picked up an easier one so I'm doing much better with my 
        workload.

            I have been training for a half marathon in October for a few months 
            and this week I went on a long run and then my friends asked if I 
            wanted to play soccer right after. I said yes, but now I think I have a 
            stress fracture from overuse which means I won't be able to run for 6 weeks 
            and I'll miss the race :(. I'm pretty upset about that, but it's my fault 
            for doing too much so it's whatever, I'll get over it. Other than that though 
            it's been a good week!
