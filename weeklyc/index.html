            This week we learned more about css and how to style our web pages! I thought 
            the day where we just got to experiment with css was the most helpful day of 
            class so far as I learn better by doing instead of following along. I thought 
            W3Schools was an awesome resource for learning css and it is so easy to find what 
            you are trying to do and use it as a reference.

            I still struggle a bit with images and how to style them but I will hopefully 
            get better as time goes on. I can't seem to figure out how to get images to appear 
            when I put them in css as background images without putting it in the tag so 
            I just decided to put it in html and manipulate it that way which seems to work a bit 
            better. However, when adding elements through css they don't seem to agree with the 
            images too well.
