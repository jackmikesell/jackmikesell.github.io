            Overall I feel like I had a pretty good week! I was very 
            overwhelmed with homework but I still managed to find time 
            to hang out with friends. On Tuesday, I went to see Deathly Hallows 
            Part 1 with some peeps and then Thursday, Friday, and Saturday I 
            got to see some other friends, even one of my best friends from 
            highschool! I'm very grateful for the people in my life, I don't know 
            what I would do without them.

            Besides the stress from all this schoolwork, I have been really happy 
            lately so I can't complain about the workload. I wish I had more freetime 
            to do things I want to do, but honestly, I probably would have a lot more 
            if I managed my time better so that's my goal for this week. I am going to 
            try to get all my work finished right after classes instead of taking a sec 
            to rest, and I can just relax after I finish everything. I'll report back on 
            how it went with weekly c! Wow these assignments are actually nice, feels good 
            to get some thought out hahaha.
