        <p>You walk towards the village and find yourself in the town's 
            square. You can hear the music in a nearby pub, but before you 
            go inside a beggar asks you to come over.
        </p>

            Do you continue into the <a href="pub.html">pub</a>?

        <p>
            Or go talk to the <a href="beggar.html">beggar</a>?
