        <p>You look at the dog and feel so sorry for it. You risk it and 
            decide to try and save it, even if it means risking your own 
            life. You reach for the food and grab it off the shelf, but 
            instead of coming for you while you have your back turned, the 
            dog whimpers and sits down by it's bowl. You pour the food in and 
            the dog licks you a few times before going for the bowl.

        <p>You blink, but when you open your eyes, you're back in the Great Hall 
            with the sorting hat on your head. It tells you it's seen all it needs
            to make its <a href="hufflepuff.html">decision.</a>
