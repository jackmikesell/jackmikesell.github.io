        <p>You swim towards the kelp and after weaving through the stalks, 
            you find a mermaid. But she doesn't look happy to see you. She yells 
            at you in a language you can't understand, and then throws a spear that 
            only barely misses your side. She grabs another and starts swimming towards 
            you. Out of the corner of your eye you see another spear only a few feet 
            away. You think about grabbing the spear, but you're not sure if you want or 
            feel the need to fight the mermaid.
        </p>
        <p>Do you <a href="spear.html">grab the spear</a> and get ready for the incoming mermaid?</p>
        <p>Or do you see if you can <a href="reason.html">reason with her?</a></p>
