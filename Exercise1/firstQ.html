        <p>Professor McGonagall calls your name and you nervously walk 
            to the center of the stage. You sit on a stool as she
            slips a raggedy old hat on your head.
        </p>
        <p> Suddenly, everything goes dark</p>
        <p> You find yourself outside in a beautiful
            meadow. To your right is a forest, and you seem to be able to
            hear a stream flowing somewhere inside. To your left, not far,
            is a small village with lively music.
