            You walk into the pub and a majority of the residents turn to stare at you.
            You feel incredibly uncomfortable and are about to leave when a witch waves 
            you over to her table.
        </p>
        <p>
            She doesn't talk at all and only cackles. She places two potions in front of 
            you. Of course you want nothing to do with this and try to get up but can't. 
            You then look at the two potions. One looks like a mud pie but you get the 
            feeling it will turn you into a frog. The other looks like water but something 
            tells you it will swap your feet with entire mattresses
        </p>
        <p>Do you drink the <a href="mudpie.html">mud pie potion?</a></p>
        <p>Or the <a href="mattress.html">potion that looks like water?</a></p>
        <p> </p>
        <p><a href="bothPotions.html">Drink both.</a></p>
