            You walk over to the pond, but you notice the glow of the 
            mysterious object is becoming brighter and the swirl of the
            starts growing quickly. The swirl grows at least 10 feet tall
            before snatching you and pulling you into the depths of the pond.

            The pond looks MUCH bigger from the inside, as if there's some
            engorging charm in effect. You see some gillyweed at the bottom, and
            decide to eat it so at least you can have gills and explore the area
            without needing to breathe air.

            In the distance is an enormous kelp forest with thousands of fish
            swimming around. You think you might be able hear voices within
            the kelp too. But suddenly, you find that the glow was coming from a 
            chest at the bottom of the pond. The chest looks incredibly powerful, 
            but also gives you an uneasy feeling.

        <p>Do you go <a href="kelp.html">into the kelp forest</a> to investigate the voices?</p>
        <p>Or do you go try to <a href="chest.html">discover what's in the chest?</a></p>
