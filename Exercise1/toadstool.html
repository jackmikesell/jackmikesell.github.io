        <p>You walk over to the toadstools, and find that they are really
            talking! However, they stop as soon as you approach until the 
            biggest one of them acknowledges you. He asks you to come closer...
            You obey until your face is just 6 inches away from his top. He 
            looks old, yet wise. But suddenly, he releases a massive cloud of
            spores right in your face! You become dizzy, fall over, and your 
            vision turns dark once again.
        </p>
        <p>You wake up in an abandoned shed, but you're not alone. In the other
            corner a dog is gnashing it's teeth and growling at you. He looks
            hungry, and ready to devower you as soon as you turn your back. 
            Luckily, you're right by the door. As you're about to leave, you notice
            some food on one of the shelves in the shed. You think about feeding
            the dog, but it seems to be getting more aggressive and you feel if
            you stay any longer, you'll surely get killed.

        Do you risk it and <a href="feedDog.html">feed the vicious dog?</a></p>
        <p>Or do you <a href="leaveShed.html">get out of there before you become dog food?</a></p>
