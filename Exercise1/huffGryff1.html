        <p>You walk into the forest and keep following the sound of
            the water. You arrive at a small, but fast flowing stream,
            and decide to sit down and listen to the water. You close your
            eyes to fully take it in, but when you open them, you find 
            yourself in an enchanted garden. There's interesting sights
            all over but two seem to catch your eye the most. Do you first
            go to the bubbling pond where something glowing is causing the 
            water to swirl, or walk over to the fat, red toadstools that
            seem to be talking to one another?
