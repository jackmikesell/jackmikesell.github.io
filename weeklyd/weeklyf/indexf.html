                This week we learned some demos which might be helpful for 
                project 1! At the very least they give some inspiration for 
                what we could do with our web page. I haven't really run into 
                any issues while creating project 1 yet, but that's probably 
                because I've started with the easy stuff first...

                I have some fun ideas for the project that I'm excited to 
                implement this week! (or at least try). I feel like I learn a 
                lot on our work days which is nice. Doing the activities on my own 
                helps reinforce how the languages work in my head, moreso than 
                watching and following along I think.
