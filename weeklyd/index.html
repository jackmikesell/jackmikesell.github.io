                This week we didn't go over a lot of new material, 
                but I definitely enjoyed seeing what other people 
                came up with for exercise 2!
            </p>
            <p class="para-main">
                Some of the things people made with html and css were 
                so cool, and they used a lot of features I had no 
                idea even existed. Seeing the animations as well as having 
                entire web pages appear in just a window on the main page I 
                thought was really awesome and creative.
            </p>
            <p class="para-main">
                I am still getting down the basics of frontend 
                development so some of those things may be a little 
                out of my skillset right now, but maybe I'll try to 
                incorporate some new stuff like that in our next 
                exercise!
            </p>
            <p class = para-main>
                It took me a little bit to learn how to do the animation 
                on the exercise, but it really wasn't too hard and I 
                feel like I may want to try a more complicated animation 
                on the next exercise because I feel like movement adds a 
                lot to a web page.
