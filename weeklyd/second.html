                My week :p
            </h3>
            <p class="shadow-text">
                It was another stressful, but very good week! 
                Per usual I had a lot of homework and studying 
                to do, but in my freetime I got back into rock 
                climbing after having a hand injury, played 
                some soccer with friends, and had some time to 
                practice the guitar!
            </p>
            <p class="shadow-text">
                I put a lot more emphasis on my personal 
                well-being this week and I think it's been 
                helping a lot because overall I feel very 
                happy! It's almost October too which means 
                Halloween - my favorite holiday - and I'm 
                really excited to do all the fun fall stuff 
                like carving pumpkins, haunted houses, and 
                all that jazz.
