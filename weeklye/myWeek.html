                This past weekend I got to go to lake Erie which was awesome 
            because I've been craving the beach - and even though it was 
            a lake beach it was super cool! Because I haven't been able 
            to run recently due to an injury, I've gotten back into rock 
            climbing with one of my friends who goes a lot and i'm 
            improving pretty quickly which I'm super happy about. We're 
            even going with a group of friends to Red River Gorge for 
            fall break to climb outdoors which I've wanted to do for a 
            while now.
