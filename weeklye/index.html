                This week we got to see some tutorials on how to make 
                a navigation bar, as well as how to alter images on our 
                web pages.
            </p>
            <p class="para-main">
                I enjoyed the navigation bar tutorial a lot because I have
                 seen similar nav bars on other websites and it was 
                 interesting to see how they can be made. I think I will
                  want to do something similar on our project for this
                   class, but I'm not sure yet.

                I liked seeing the examples of other people's projects 
                as they had some really cool ideas! Some of those people 
                have a lot more skill than I do when it comes to front-end 
                design, but they gave me some ideas that I might be able 
                to implement too! I recently started my outline for the 
                project as well, and I like how it looks so far! I am just 
                hoping I'll be able to actually implement all of the things 
                I want to do.
