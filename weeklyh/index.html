        <h1 class="header">Weekly H!</h1>

        <p class="para1">This week was pretty fun in Internet Art! I really liked trying 
            out javascript because it felt more like the computer programming 
            i've been used to in other classes. With CSS and html, if I didn't 
            kow how to do something I would normally look it up to see if anyone 
            online could help. With javascript I felt like I could actually problem-solve 
            on my own using the documentation and programming experience which was super fun!
        </p>

        <p class="para2">
            So far I think javascript is my favorite language we've used. It seems 
            like there's a lot of interesting stuff you can do with it too. drawing shapes 
            and seeing them actually move and change based on the code you wrote was very rewarding 
            in my opinion. I'm excited to try and implement cool features on our next project with it!
        </p>

        <p class="para1">
            Seeing everyone's designs for the exercise was really interesting too as people had very different ideas. 
            I really liked the mouse effects that some people did and I may want to try them myself at some point! 
            Anyways, <a class="link" href="myWeek.html">here's a little about my week.</a>
