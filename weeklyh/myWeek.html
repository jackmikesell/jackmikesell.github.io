        <p class="para2">I was a bit sick at the beginning of the week, but overall it was pretty good 
            surprisingly! I haven't been a big fan of the time change and having less daylight 
            but it hasn't been affecting me as much as it normally does which is nice. 
        </p>

        <p class="para1">Other than that, I hung out with friends some, watched a bit of the new Scott Pilgrim animated 
            series, and I got a few V4s in rock climbing which doesn't make any sense to someone reading but 
            i'm really happy with it :p .
